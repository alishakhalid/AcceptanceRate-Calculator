# Acceptance-Rate-Calculator
## Project idea
This project calculates the acceptance rate of students who have finished their apprenticeship but also otherwise to test how high the chance would be to occupy a certain study or job. The program will ask at the beginning if the user would like to go study or work. According to it's decision the program will ask some question for the user to answer and based on that the acceptance rate will be calculated.
